# Classes


## Models
####Point.java - This class models a 2D Point.

## Utils
####SomeWriterClass.java - Helper class for writing (needs to be implemented)
####SomeReaderClass.java - Helper for reading (needs to be implemented)
####StdDraw.java - This library is used for plotting the points in 2D space. (https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/StdDraw.java.html)

To implement different algorithms, we can use Strategy Design Pattern.

## Main
####AlgorithmDriver.java - The context class for loading different algorithm strategies.
####Main.java - Entry point in the program

## Algorithms
####AbstractTSP.java - Interface to model the generic form of an algorithm
####BruteForceTSP.java - Concrete implementation of an algorithm
